## Setup

### 1. Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/furcom/Fyprland.git ~/Fyprland && ~/Fyprland/install.sh
```

### 2. Install (Read Infos before installing!)
```
~/Fyprland/install.sh
```

## Infos
1. Optimized for `1920x1200` screen resolution. Things could look messed up on different screen resolutions.
2. This script will install packages and copy/overwrite files without asking!  
    - It is recommended to use this script on a fresh Arch install or look into the script and backup the files, which will be overwritten!
3. Switching Wallpapers: Open settings menu by pressing `SUPER+I` keys > Go to `Hyprland` > Go to `Wallpaper` > Choose an image
    - Images are stored in `~/.config/hypr/images/wallpapers`
    - The wallpaper changer script currently only supports PNG files. Will be fixed soon...
4. Enable/disable Window Bar: Open settings menu by pressing `SUPER+I` keys > Go to `Hyprland` > Go to `Window Bar` > Enable/disable
    - In CLI: `hyprpm enable hyprbars` or `hyprpm disable hyprbars`
5. Some configs will be generated by wallust because of dynamic color palettes.
    - Templates are stored in `~/.config/wallust/templates`
    - You need to look into the config file too for templates `~/.config/wallust/wallust.toml`
6. Installed packages:
    - If you don't want to install a specific package (e.g. `fusuma`) go to the bottom inside of the `install.sh` file where it says `MAIN SCRIPT` and comment the package by adding a hash symbol at the start of the line (e.g. `#install_fusuma`)
